# Chrome-Dino-Game-Using-AI
I created a ML Model to play the Chrome Dino Game. 

It still needs to be modified as the Train Set becomes so large that it doesn't fit in RAM. So I need to use MiniBatches but it is difficult to create Mini-Batches such that each minibatch contains atleast 2 types of classes. Else, everything works perfect!
